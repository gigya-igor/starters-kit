		Description:
		Sample on how to populate a field in a Gigya screen set
		Specifically: ask the user to fill out a screen with just an email address, then take that email
		address and populate the gigya-login-screen with the email from the first screen.

			function populateEmail (evt) {
				// Since this "populateEmail" function is fired everytime a screen loads we have to 
				// ensure that we only try to populate the email when the current screen is the login screen:
				if (evt.currentScreen == 'gigya-login-screen') {
					// If the current screen is the login screen, populate the email input:
					$('.emailAddress > .gigya-input-text').val(email);
					// I added "emailAddress" as a "custom class" to the input box in the UI Builder.
				};
			};
			function retrieveEmail (evt) {
				// Do some server-side logic to find the user and see if they are an IDP user, or a "native" user.
				// NOTE: this server-side logic must be done synchronously, otherwise Gigya will continue to the next
				// screen without waiting for a response from your function.
				// If they are a native user, continue below:
				// The "evt" object contains the form data of what Gigya is about to submit
				email = evt.formData['profile.email'];
				// Switch from email only field to login screen:
				gigya.accounts.switchScreen({
					screenSet: 'Default2-RegistrationLogin',
					screen: 'gigya-login-screen',
					containerID: 'gigyaContainer'
				});
				// Return false for the "onBeforeSubmit" so that Gigya doesn't automatically make the API call
				// to actually try to edit someone's profile (since this is a "edit profile" behaviour screen)
				return false;
			};
			// Load the Gigya screen set which only asks for the email address:
			// NOTE: the behaviour for my sample screen is "Edit Profile"
			// and it contains an input box which is tied to "profile.email" in the "Mapped Fields".
			// onBeforeSubmit will catch the email address that they input and call a function
			// onAfterScreenLoad will fire everytime a new screen is loaded
			gigya.accounts.showScreenSet({
				screenSet: 'Default2-RegistrationLogin',
				startScreen: 'gigya-retrieve-email',
				containerID: 'gigyaContainer',
				onBeforeSubmit: retrieveEmail,
				onAfterScreenLoad: populateEmail
			});
